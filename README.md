**RPGAddOns**

RPGAddOns interfaces with existing RPGMod systems to provide a way for players to reset their level for additional stats and rewards. Prestige will be similar but the points will be earned from VBloods. Will add more once level resetting and prestiging are in a decent spot. Configuration options currently exist for the extra stats given to players when resetting, max number of resets, item rewards on/off, item prefab, item quantity, buff rewards for resetting on/off, buff rewards for prestiging on/off, buff prefab list for resets, and buff prefab list for prestiges.
